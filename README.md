# OBD-II Data Analysis Electron App

## Overview

This Electron-based desktop application provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing OBD-II data from vehicles. It supports live data visualization, graph plotting, and detailed raw data analysis from CAN (Controller Area Network) bus communication, allowing users to gain insights into vehicle diagnostics and performance.

The app is built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), and integrates with `can-utils` to interact with vehicle CAN bus data. It is designed for automotive engineers, data analysts, and hobbyists interested in vehicle diagnostics.
